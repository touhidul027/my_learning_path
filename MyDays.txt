*I done finished Data Struture and Algorithms in java by rebert Lafore 
But I want to finish"Introduction to Algorithms" too (coremen).

[JUNE 15- JUNE 21]
PLAN FOR WEEK 25 {
    1. Coding for Finding the closest pair of points
    3. Implementing simple message module using JAX-RS
    WEEK 24 Outcome : 75% {
       1. Knew theory,but code implementation not complete
       2. Done watched tutorial
    }
}

PLAN FOR WEEK 24 {
    1. Finding the closest pair of points
    2. Learn about Advanced JAX-RS
    WEEK 23 Result : {
    
    }
}

---> anonymous stusy <---
February 13
	*counting numbers in an given array between numbers

Februry 10
	* implement Counting Sort

February 9
    *Implement Min heap data structure

=> Preparation for interview,did not notedown of what I have been done

February 1,2020
    * Studying book of rest api

January 19
    *Implemented priotity queue using MaxHeap

January 15
    *Implemented priotity queue
	* overviewing exercising of chapter 7; coremen books

Januray 13
    *Implementing Heap Sort using max-heap.[Increasing order]

January 12
    *Implementing Rest Controller for Task,it is ongoing;next need to implement
     service along with inmemory db

January 11
    * Tried recursive version of tricleUp,tricleDown method for heap program.

January 7,2020
    * Tried recursive version of tricleUp method for heap program.Not needed now
	* Overviewing practicum management system,need to work a little

January 6,2020
	*I do not like whatever I am doing in office-booring r&d
	*Implemented heap.java program
		->trying recursive version, but did not gave result as expected, need to investigate more

January 5,2020
   * Study Spring article
   * Implementing HeapSort data structure(Although I did it earlier-but I want to finish Intro
     duction to Algorithms)

January 4,2020
  * Reading Spring Framework article,collecting much many number of interview question in pdf,doc
   format

January 3,2020
In office, UWA framework.
In home, HeapSort-> Data Struvture
